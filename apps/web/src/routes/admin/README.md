# Admin Interface

The admin interface at `/admin` provides content management capabilities for the Hyprnote website.

## Authentication

Access is restricted to whitelisted email addresses defined in `src/lib/team.ts` (`ADMIN_EMAILS`):

- yujonglee@hyprnote.com
- yujonglee.dev@gmail.com
- john@hyprnote.com
- marketing@hyprnote.com
- harshika.alagh@gmail.com
- yunhyungjo@yonsei.ac.kr

Users must be authenticated via Supabase to access admin routes. Non-admin users are redirected to the home page. In development mode, authentication is bypassed with a mock `dev@local` user.

## Features

### Media Library (`/admin/media`)

Upload, organize, and manage media assets stored in Supabase Storage.

- Drag-and-drop file upload with per-file progress toasts
- Folder navigation with lazy-loaded folder tree in sidebar
- Tab-based navigation with pinning, reordering, and back/forward history
- Multi-select with batch delete and download
- Context menu for individual file actions (rename, replace, copy path, download, move, delete)
- Sidebar with search, file type filters, and expandable folder tree
- Drag-and-drop files between folders
- Resizable sidebar/content panels

### Content Management (`/admin/collections`)

Full-featured blog editor with the following capabilities:

- Create, edit, and manage blog articles
- Rich text editor (TipTap) with Google Docs import modal
- Metadata panel (title, display title, description, author, date, category, cover image, featured flag)
- Preview mode with side-by-side editing via resizable panels
- Git history tracking per file
- Draft management with branch-based workflow
- Tab-based file navigation with pinning, reordering, and close actions
- Inline new post creation and file renaming in sidebar
- Media selector modal for choosing cover images from the media library
- Clipboard operations (cut, copy) for content items
- Auto-save countdown indicator

Requires GitHub credentials (stored in Supabase `admins` table). Users without GitHub credentials are redirected to authenticate via GitHub.

#### Editorial Workflow

Complete flow from editing to publication:

**1. User Edits a Published Article**
- Open `/admin/collections` and select a published article
- Make changes in the editor

**2. User Clicks "Save"**
- Creates a new branch `blog/{slug}-{timestamp}` (or uses existing one)
- Commits with `ready_for_review: false` in frontmatter
- Creates/updates PR to `main`

**3. GitHub Actions Trigger**
- `blog-auto-format.yml` - Auto-formats MDX files with dprint, commits changes back to branch
- `blog-grammar-check.yml` - Runs AI grammar check (Anthropic), posts suggestions as PR comment
- `blog-slack-notify.yml` - Sends Slack notification (green border):
  ```
  ✏️ @user made changes to *Article Title*
  ```

**4. User Continues Editing (Optional)**
- Each "Save" updates the same PR branch
- Each push triggers workflows again

**5. User Clicks "Submit for Review"**
- Updates frontmatter to `ready_for_review: true`
- Adds `ComputelessComputer` as PR reviewer

**6. GitHub Actions Trigger Again**
- Slack notification changes to (blue border):
  ```
  👀 *Article submitted for review*
  @john please review
  ```

**7. Reviewer Merges PR**
- Article goes live on the website

**Slack Notification Summary:**

| Action | `ready_for_review` | Slack Message | Border |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| New Article | `false` | "🚀 ready to publish a new article" | Green |
| Save (edit) | `false` | "✏️ made changes" | Green |
| Submit for Review | `true` | "👀 submitted for review" @john | Blue |
| Unpublish | n/a | "⚠️ wants to unpublish" | Amber |

Slack messages include **Preview**, **View PR**, and **Merge** action buttons.

## API Endpoints

All API endpoints require admin authentication (bypassed in development mode).

- `POST /api/admin/media/delete` - Delete files (batch)
- `POST /api/admin/media/move` - Move/rename files
- `POST /api/admin/media/create-folder` - Create folders

### Blog APIs

### Import APIs

- `POST /api/admin/import/google-docs` - Parse published Google Doc
- `POST /api/admin/import/save` - Save MDX file to repository

### Content APIs

- `GET /api/admin/content/list` - List content files in a folder
- `GET /api/admin/content/list-drafts` - List draft articles from branches
- `GET /api/admin/content/pending-pr` - Check if article has a pending edit PR
- `GET /api/admin/content/get-branch-file` - Get file content from a branch
- `GET /api/admin/content/history` - Get git commit history for a file
- `POST /api/admin/content/save` - Save content (creates PR for published articles)
- `POST /api/admin/content/create` - Create new content file
- `POST /api/admin/content/publish` - Publish/unpublish an article

## GitHub Workflows

The editorial workflow is powered by three GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

- **`blog-auto-format.yml`** - Auto-formats MDX files with dprint on push to `blog/**` branches and commits changes back
- **`blog-grammar-check.yml`** - Runs AI-powered grammar check (Anthropic) on article PRs and posts suggestions as comments
- **`blog-slack-notify.yml`** - Sends Slack notifications for article changes with editorial status detection (edit, new article, submit for review, unpublish)

`blog-grammar-check.yml` and `blog-slack-notify.yml` trigger on PRs to `main` that modify `apps/web/content/articles/**` on `blog/` branches. `blog-auto-format.yml` triggers on pushes to `blog/**` branches.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub personal access token with repo write access
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Anthropic API key for AI grammar checking
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - Slack bot token for sending notifications
- `SLACK_BLOG_CHANNEL_ID` - Slack channel ID for blog notifications
- Supabase environment variables for authentication and storage

## Development

The admin interface uses TanStack Router (React Start) with file-based routing. Routes are defined in:

- `src/routes/admin/` - Page components
- `src/routes/api/admin/` - API endpoints
- `src/hooks/use-media-api.tsx` - Media API client hook
- `src/functions/admin.ts` - Admin authentication helpers
- `src/lib/team.ts` - Admin email whitelist and team member data

Admin authentication is handled by the `fetchAdminUser()` function which checks if the current user's email is in the `ADMIN_EMAILS` whitelist.
