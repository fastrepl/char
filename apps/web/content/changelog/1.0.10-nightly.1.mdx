## AI

- **Pre-meeting notes are now passed to the AI** as a separate section 
    - So summaries better reflect what actually changed during the meeting versus what was prepared beforehand
- Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Foundry are now supported as LLM providers (beta)
- Enhance(summarize) now stays active correctly when switching between tabs

## Notes

- Hovering over a session in the sidebar or tab bar now shows a preview card with its title, date, participants, and a text snippet
- Typing `@` with no query now shows default suggestions — sessions, people, and organizations — instead of an empty dropdown
- Long mention names are truncated so they don't overflow the editor
- Links now open on hover instead of requiring Cmd+Click

## Export

- Export options are consolidated into a single **Export** button that opens a modal
    - choose format (PDF, TXT, Markdown) and what to include (summary, memos, transcript)

## Audio

- Playback speed is now configurable directly in the transcript view

## Settings

- Detect notifications in the settings is now properly respected
