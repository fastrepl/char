## Transcription

- Fixed transcript segmentation producing incorrect splits between speakers
- Smarter mic detection: when mic usage is detected, the notification now lists nearby calendar events so you can jump straight into the right session

## Notes

- Links no longer bleed into adjacent typed text when editing near a link boundary
- Pressing Enter on an empty line now clears active inline formatting (bold, italic, underline)
- Link hover tooltip is now correctly positioned for links near the top of the editor

## Audio

- Recordings are now saved as MP3 files

## Calendar

- Session creation from a calendar event now correctly populates participants from event attendees
- Calendar onboarding now shows a **Request Access to Calendar** button instead of a dead-end "No calendars found" message

## Onboarding

- Redesigned onboarding flow with clearer step states, checkmark completion indicators, and auto-scroll navigation between steps

## Auth

- Fixed sign-in flow when the user was already logged into char.com in their browser

## Other fixes and improvements

- Fixed red artifact line appearing in the left sidebar timeline
- Fixed account page side borders not extending to full height
- "Resume listening" now appears in the overflow menu when a transcript already exists, instead of "Start listening"
