section: "Who We Want"
summary: "Grit, intellectual honesty, sharpness, and a vivid vector — plus deep competence in your craft."

**Grit.** Building a startup is hard. We need people who push through with resilience and purpose. Not blindly, but committed to the mission when progress feels slow.

**Intellectual honesty.** Say "I don't know" or "I was wrong." Seek truth over being right. Challenge ideas constructively. Update views with better evidence.

**Sharpness.** Think quickly, communicate clearly, execute decisively. Be effective under pressure and make good decisions fast.

**A vivid vector.** We think of people as a collection of vectors. You don't need to care about everything we care about. But you need a vivid vector that aligns with at least one of our pillars. Artisans with clear direction and genuine passion.

## Hard skills matter too

Soft traits are essential, but we need excellence in what you do. Engineering, design, sales, operations — deep competence in your domain. Small team, everyone pulls their weight.

## What you'll gain

You'll be pushed to develop sharp perspectives and refine your craft alongside a small team that cares deeply. We hold ourselves to the same standards we ask of you — and we expect you to call us out when we fall short.
