We don't differentiate through features. We build a brand.

**Open source is a brand.** People who love open source often cite transparency, security, or ownership. But at its core, it's preference, like choosing Philz over Starbucks. We embrace that identity fully.

**Cloud isn't the differentiator.** Most AI notetakers are built on similar infrastructure: the same API providers, the same underlying models. Users don't choose based on whose cloud is better. They choose based on the experience and the trust they feel.

**Branding is reputation.** It's how people think about us. We earn that through consistency, transparency, and building something people genuinely want to use.

**Values over feature lists.** We use terms like control, ownership, no lock-in, no strings attached. These are the principles that guide every decision. The features follow from the values.
