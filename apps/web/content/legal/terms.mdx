## 1. Agreement to Terms

By accessing or using Char ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

Char provides a note-taking and productivity application that helps users capture, organize, and manage their notes and information.

### 2.1 Local-First Architecture

Char is designed as a local-first application. Your notes, transcripts, and meeting data are stored locally on your device in a local database. You can run Char completely offline by using a local language model (e.g., via LM Studio or Ollama). Cloud-based features — such as cloud transcription and AI summarization — are optional and require an internet connection.

### 2.2 Account and Cloud Features

During the initial setup, Char creates an account so you can experience the full product — including cloud-powered transcription and summarization — at its best quality. This lets you see what Char can do before deciding how you want to use it. If you prefer a fully local setup, you can continue using Char offline with a local LLM after onboarding. If you no longer wish to maintain an account, you can request account deletion at any time (see Section 3.3).

## 3. User Accounts

### 3.1 Account Creation

To use certain features of the Service, you must register for an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process.

### 3.2 Account Security

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.

### 3.3 Account Deletion

You may request deletion of your account at any time by visiting [char.com/app/account](https://char.com/app/account) or by contacting us at privacy@char.com. Upon account deletion, your cloud-stored data will be removed within 30 days. Your locally stored data remains on your device and is not affected by account deletion. After deleting your account, Char will continue to function with local-only features.

## 4. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for any illegal purpose or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law
- Violate or encourage others to violate any right of a third party, including intellectual property rights
- Post, upload, or distribute any content that is unlawful, defamatory, libelous, or infringing
- Distribute viruses, malware, or other harmful computer code
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks

## 5. Intellectual Property

The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Fastrepl, Inc. and are protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws.

## 6. User Content

### 6.1 Ownership

You retain all rights to the content you create, upload, or store using the Service ("User Content").

### 6.2 License

By uploading User Content to the Service, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, store, and process your User Content solely for the purpose of providing the Service to you.

## 7. Payment Terms

Certain features of the Service may require payment. You agree to pay all fees associated with your use of paid features. All fees are non-refundable unless otherwise specified.

## 8. Communications and Marketing

By providing your email address to us—whether through account registration, waitlist sign-ups, download reminders, or any other form on our website—you consent to receive communications from us. These communications may include:

- **Transactional messages:** Account confirmations, password resets, and service-related notices
- **Product updates:** Information about new features, improvements, and releases
- **Marketing communications:** Newsletters, promotional content, and other updates about Char and related offerings

You may opt out of marketing communications at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in any marketing email or by contacting us at legal@char.com. Opting out of marketing communications will not affect transactional or service-related messages.

## 9. Privacy and Third-Party Services

Your use of the Service is also governed by our Privacy Policy and Data Processing Agreement. Please review our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy) and [Data Processing Agreement](/legal/dpa) to understand our practices.

The Service may integrate with third-party services to provide certain features, including cloud-based transcription, AI-powered summarization, payment processing, and analytics. When you enable cloud-based features, your data may be processed by our sub-processors as described in our Data Processing Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that your use of these features is subject to the terms and privacy practices of such third-party services.

## 10. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your account and access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including if you breach these Terms.

## 11. Disclaimers

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 12. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL FASTREPL, INC., ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.
