## 1. Introduction

Fastrepl, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") operates Char. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our application and services.

## 2. Local-First Design

Char is a local-first application. Your notes, transcripts, and meeting data are stored locally on your device. During onboarding, an account is created so you can experience cloud-powered features (such as cloud transcription and AI summarization) at their best quality. You may choose to use Char entirely offline with a local language model. If you no longer wish to maintain an account, you can request deletion at [char.com/app/account](https://char.com/app/account) or by contacting us at privacy@char.com.
