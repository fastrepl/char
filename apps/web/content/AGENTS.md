## What Char Is

Char is an open-source AI notepad for meetings built for high-agency people who demand complete control over their data and AI stack.

## Core Philosophy

**Zero lock-in.** Char gives users ownership at the foundational level—your files, your AI, your workflow. No lock-in. No compromises.

**Files over apps.** Everything is stored as plain markdown files on the user's device, not in proprietary databases or cloud servers.

**Secure by design.** IT team can audit the code and you can use the AI provider your security team approves.

**Simple but powerful.** Complete control without complexity. The tool doesn't get in your way.

## Target Audience (in this order)

1. Engineers, developers, technical founders
2. Privacy-conscious professionals (lawyers, healthcare, finance)
3. People who already use tools like Obsidian, Notion, or local-first workflows
4. People whose company has banned other cloud-based tools like Otter, ChatGPT, Granola
5. Open source enthusiasts
6. People who already have unused LLM API credits
