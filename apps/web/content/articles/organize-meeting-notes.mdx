You walk out of a meeting, send a summary to the team, and feel good about it. Three weeks later someone asks "what did we decide about the timeline?" and you spend twenty minutes digging through Slack, your inbox, and two different apps before giving up and scheduling another meeting to redecide something you already decided.

Most meeting notes disappear because finding them three weeks later proves nearly impossible, even though people wrote them down at the time. The core issue isn't writing things down; it's that teams pick note systems without considering how they'll actually retrieve information later, which means the search method determines whether notes get used or abandoned within a few weeks.

## Before You Pick a System: How Do You Search for Things?

If you naturally remember when meetings happened, date-based search works. If you think in terms of who was involved, you need people-based search. If you organize around topics and projects, tag-based systems make sense. Fighting against your natural search pattern creates enough friction that you'll eventually stop using the tool, regardless of how good it is.

## Seven Systems for Organizing Meeting Notes

### **1. AI Meeting Assistants**

These tools record and transcribe automatically, which solves the problem of people forgetting to take notes in the first place. Otter and Fireflies handle search well enough if you think in terms of projects and dates, though your transcripts live on their servers and you should check export options before committing. Char takes a different approach by saving everything as markdown on your device, which matters if you want to own your files or move between tools without losing everything.

### **2. Note Apps (Notion, Obsidian, Evernote, OneNote, Logseq)**

Notion treats notes as database rows that you can filter and query. Obsidian builds a linked web between documents. Logseq focuses on daily notes with built-in task management, which some teams prefer because it forces a regular review cadence. The main advantage here is that markdown imports cleanly, so you can start with AI transcripts and move them into whichever structure makes sense for your team. If you're building a knowledge base where ideas connect to each other rather than just sitting in chronological order, these tools do that well.

### **3. A Spreadsheet or Database Index**

One row per meeting. Columns for date, attendees, project name, key decisions, action items, and a link to the full notes. You can filter by project or search for every meeting where a specific person was involved, which scattered documents in multiple tools can't do. This is particularly useful when you need to track how decisions evolved across multiple conversations, or when you're trying to figure out why your team decided something six months ago. The spreadsheet doesn't replace your notes; it just makes them findable.

### **4. CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Attio, Folk)**

Opening a contact in your CRM should show you the complete conversation history with that person. Most teams write notes somewhere else and import them because CRM text editors are clunky for real-time note-taking during calls. Sales teams, recruiters, and anyone doing account management will use this whether they like it or not, since the CRM is already central to their workflow and scattering customer conversations across multiple systems creates worse problems than dealing with a mediocre text editor.

### **5. Wiki-Style Tools (Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki)**

Wikis fail unless someone owns them. I've watched this happen repeatedly: teams set up a wiki, everyone contributes for two weeks, contradictions start piling up, nobody fixes them because it's unclear whose job that is, and within six months people stop checking it because they can't trust what's there. If you have someone who will actually maintain the wiki and keep it accurate, great. If not, you're building a graveyard for stale information that will actively confuse people later.

### **6. Email to Yourself**

This sounds too simple to work, but people who already live in their inbox find it surprisingly effective. Notes land in the same place as all your other email, which means you only need to remember one search interface instead of trying to recall which of seven tools you used for a specific meeting. Gmail and Outlook search work well enough that you can find things by participant name, date range, or keywords in the subject line. The main downside is that this doesn't scale well once you're taking notes from multiple meetings per day, since your inbox becomes cluttered and the notes aren't structured in any meaningful way.

### **7. GTD and Other Processing Methodologies**

These systems ask you to write raw notes during meetings, then process them later into action items and reference material. The processing step is where most teams fail. Raw notes accumulate in an inbox, the weekly review never happens, and you're back to having unorganized information that nobody can find. If you already have a processing habit that works, this can be effective. If you don't, adding a processing requirement to your note-taking workflow just creates another place where information gets stuck.

## Picking a System

Your capture tool determines what you can do with your notes later. Platform-specific formats create lock-in; plain text files give you options. Char saves markdown locally, which means you can open the same files in Obsidian, Notion, VS Code, or any other editor without converting or exporting anything. The tool you use to take notes shouldn't dictate where those notes live five years from now.
