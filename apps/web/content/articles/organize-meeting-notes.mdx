You take notes. You just can't find them when it matters. Here's how to fix that, whatever tool you use.

## Best Ways to Organize Your Meeting Notes

1. **Use Your Tool's Built-In Features**

Before building any system on top, most people underuse what their note-taking app already gives them. Conversational search across your meeting history, structured summaries with decisions and action items automatically pulled out, custom templates for different meeting types. Char, Otter, Granola, Fireflies, all of them have this to some degree.

Start there. Search is good enough now that a lot of organizational overhead simply isn't necessary anymore. Most things you'd want to find are one query away.

2. **If You're Using Char, You Are Sorted**

Char does everything above, but it stores your notes as plain markdown files on your own device. That one difference opens up a lot.

Markdown files are just text. Any tool can read them, which means your meeting history isn't locked in a platform. It travels with you, works with anything, and stays yours regardless of what Char does in the future.

In practice that means you can open your notes folder directly in Obsidian and start linking meetings to projects, people, and ideas. Drop the same folder into Logseq if you prefer a more task-and-outline focused workflow. Open it in VS Code and run search across hundreds of files in seconds. Point Claude Code at the folder to organize it how you'd like.

None of that requires any setup beyond having the files on your computer. That's the point.
