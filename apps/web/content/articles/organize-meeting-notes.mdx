You take notes. You just can't find them when it matters. Here's how to fix that, whatever tool you use.

## Best Ways to Organize Your Meeting Notes

1. **Use Your Tool's Built-In Features**

Before building any system on top, most people underuse what their note-taking app already gives them. Conversational search across your meeting history, structured summaries with decisions and action items automatically pulled out, custom templates for different meeting types. Char, Otter, Granola, Fireflies, all of them have this to some degree.

Start there. Search is good enough now that a lot of organizational overhead simply isn't necessary anymore. Most things you'd want to find are one query away.
