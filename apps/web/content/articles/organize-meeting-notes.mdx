You walk out of a meeting, send a summary to the team, and feel good about it. Three weeks later someone asks "what did we decide about the timeline?" and you spend twenty minutes digging through Slack, your inbox, and two different apps before giving up and scheduling another meeting to redecide something you already decided.

Most meeting notes disappear because they're impossible to find three weeks later, even though people wrote them down at the time. This guide covers seven systems, what each does well, and how to pick one that fits how you work.

## Before You Pick a System: How Do You Search for Things?

Teams pick a note tool based on hype, then abandon it within weeks. The better starting question is how you search for things after a meeting.

Your search strategy determines which system works: by when (chronological), by who (CRMs and contact tools), or by what (tags and full-text search). A system aligned with how you already think about past conversations will stick longer than one that forces a new habit.

## Seven Systems for Organizing Meeting Notes

### **1. AI Meeting Assistants**

**Best for:** teams that want transcripts without manual filing.

The tool records, transcribes, and summarizes each meeting automatically, giving you a structured summary with search built in.

Otter and Fireflies let you search across all meetings, tag by project, and find specific statements by date. The downside is vendor lock-in: your notes live on their servers, so switching tools depends on export functionality, and canceling means losing access.

Char saves to markdown files on your device, so you own them without cloud dependency.

### **2. Dedicated Note Apps (Notion, Obsidian, Evernote, OneNote, Logseq)**

**Best for:** building a linked knowledge base.

Markdown files import cleanly into Notion and Obsidian without reformatting - if you use Char for capture, your notes folder opens directly in any of these tools.

Notion functions as a queryable database; Obsidian as a linked web closer to a personal wiki; Logseq emphasizes daily notes and task management, which suits a different workflow entirely.

### **3. A Spreadsheet or Database Index**

**Best for:** multi-project visibility.

Create a spreadsheet with one row per meeting - date, attendees, project, decisions, action items, notes link. Use it as an index that helps you filter by project or person across dozens of meetings, which individual scattered documents make very difficult.

### **4. CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Attio, Folk)**

**Best for:** relationship-heavy roles (sales, recruiting, account management).

A CRM stores notes on contact records. Open a contact and see the full conversation history - what was promised and what happened next. Most teams avoid typing directly into CRMs and instead pipe notes in from a dedicated tool that syncs automatically.

### **5. Wiki-Style Tools (Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki)**

**Best for:** teams that maintain documentation consistently.

Notes record what happened in a meeting. Wikis document current state. Decisions should live on updated pages rather than in timestamped files that go stale, which is why the distinction matters in practice.

Most teams abandon wikis within six months, leaving contradictions across pages. Only adopt a wiki if you'll maintain it.

### **6. Email to Yourself**

**Best for:** people who rely on email search.

Notes arrive in your inbox and Gmail or Outlook search retrieves them when needed. Your inbox is already chaotic, but if you search to find things anyway, putting notes where you already look every day makes sense as a low-effort default.

### **7. GTD and Other Processing Methodologies**

**Best for:** processing workflows.

Getting Things Done, PARA, and Zettelkasten are processing frameworks. They address what you do with notes after a meeting, which is distinct from where you store them. Write notes in the moment, then process them into action items and reference material during a separate review session. Most failures happen when people skip this processing step and let raw notes accumulate without ever extracting decisions or tasks from them.

## Picking a System

Your capture tool determines everything else that follows. Platform-specific formats limit what you can do with your notes later, while plain files are portable across any tool.

Char records meetings, generates transcripts and summaries, and saves everything as markdown files on your device. From there, use them in Obsidian, Notion, or VS Code, and the files will work with whatever system you settle on.
