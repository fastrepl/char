You send meeting notes. Three weeks later, nobody can find them. You schedule another meeting to redecide what you already decided.

Meeting notes disappear because teams pick systems based on capture features and ignore retrieval entirely. The search method determines whether notes get used or abandoned.

## Automated Capture and Transcription

AI meeting assistants record and transcribe without requiring manual note-taking during conversations. Otter and Fireflies both search across projects and dates, though transcripts live on their servers and export options vary by plan. Char saves markdown locally on the device. These tools differ primarily in where files end up and how easily they transfer between systems.

The capture method affects downstream organization. A transcript becomes searchable immediately, while manual notes require someone to write them during the meeting, and most teams underestimate how often meetings end without anyone taking notes at all. Automated recordings produce complete transcripts, but the resulting volume of unstructured text requires its own organization system.

## Structured Retrieval

Note apps organize captured content in different ways. Notion stores notes as database rows that filter by properties like project, date, or attendee. Obsidian takes a linking approach where documents reference each other so relationships between meetings become visible over time. Logseq uses daily notes with built-in task management that enforces regular review. All three accept markdown imports, so AI transcripts from tools like Char or Otter feed directly into whichever structure the team already uses.

A spreadsheet index with one row per meeting (date, attendees, project, decisions, action items, notes link) enables filtering by project or searching for every conversation involving a specific person. Scattered documents across multiple tools lack this capability. The spreadsheet approach becomes most useful when tracking how decisions evolved across conversations, or when reconstructing why the team chose a direction six months ago.

CRMs like Salesforce, HubSpot, Attio, and Folk display complete conversation history when opening a contact. Most teams write notes elsewhere and import them because CRM text editors are clunky for real-time use. Sales teams, recruiters, and account managers use CRMs for this regardless of the editing experience, since customer conversations need to live in one central location.

Wiki-style tools like Confluence, Notion, and GitHub Wiki require a designated content owner. Without clear ownership, teams contribute for two weeks, contradictions pile up, nobody fixes them because responsibility remains unclear, and within six months people stop checking the wiki entirely. Active wikis always have someone reviewing and correcting content on a schedule.

## Search Method and Workflow

Teams pick note tools based on features and then search using whatever method the tool provides. The instinct to search by dates, people, or topics should drive the tool choice instead. A system that conflicts with natural search patterns gets abandoned regardless of its feature set.

Email-based note storage works for people whose workflow already centers on their inbox. Notes appear in the same place as other correspondence, and Gmail or Outlook search retrieves them by participant name, date range, or subject keywords. Multiple meetings per day create clutter, since the inbox fills up and notes lack any meaningful structure.

GTD and similar processing methodologies require writing raw notes during meetings, then processing them into action items and reference material later. Most teams skip the processing step. Raw notes accumulate, the weekly review never happens, and the result is the same unorganized mess the system was supposed to prevent.

## File Format and Portability

The capture tool determines what happens to notes when switching systems. Char saves markdown locally, and those files open in Obsidian, Notion, VS Code, or any editor without conversion. Most teams change their note-taking setup every couple of years, and format portability matters more than people expect when first picking a system. Locked-in formats make each tool migration painful.
