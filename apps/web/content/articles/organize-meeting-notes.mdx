You walk out of a meeting, send a summary to the team, and feel good about it. Three weeks later someone asks "what did we decide about the timeline?" and you spend twenty minutes digging through Slack, your inbox, and two different apps before giving up and scheduling another meeting to redecide something you already decided.

Most meeting notes disappear because they're impossible to find three weeks later, even though people wrote them down at the time. This guide covers seven systems, what each does well, and how to pick one that fits how you work.

## Before You Pick a System: How Do You Search for Things?

Most teams pick tools based on hype and abandon them within weeks. The real constraint is search: how do you find a note three weeks later?

Pick a system that matches how you naturally search—by date, by person, or by topic. Tools that fit your instinct outlast those that require new habits.

## Seven Systems for Organizing Meeting Notes

### **1. AI Meeting Assistants**

**Best for:** teams that want transcripts without manual filing.

The tool records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings. Results are searchable.

Otter and Fireflies search across meetings, tag by project, and locate statements by date. But your notes live on their servers, and switching or canceling depends on export functionality.

Char saves markdown files locally, so you own them.

### **2. Dedicated Note Apps (Notion, Obsidian, Evernote, OneNote, Logseq)**

**Best for:** building a linked knowledge base.

Markdown imports into Notion and Obsidian without reformatting. Captured notes from Char open directly in either tool.

Notion is a queryable database. Obsidian is a linked web (like a personal wiki). Logseq emphasizes daily notes and task management.

### **3. A Spreadsheet or Database Index**

**Best for:** multi-project visibility.

Create a spreadsheet with one row per meeting: date, attendees, project, decisions, action items, notes link. This lets you filter by project or person across meetings. Scattered documents lose that ability.

### **4. CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Attio, Folk)**

**Best for:** relationship-heavy roles (sales, recruiting, account management).

A CRM stores notes on contact records so you can see the full conversation history when you open a contact. Most teams pipe notes in from a dedicated tool rather than typing directly into the CRM.

### **5. Wiki-Style Tools (Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki)**

**Best for:** teams that maintain documentation consistently.

Use wikis to document current state, not timestamped notes that become outdated. Wiki pages contradict less than scattered files.

Most teams abandon wikis within six months because contradictions pile up. Only adopt a wiki if you'll maintain it.

### **6. Email to Yourself**

**Best for:** people who rely on email search.

Notes arrive in your inbox where Gmail or Outlook search can retrieve them. Since your inbox is already where you look, this matches your existing workflow.

### **7. GTD and Other Processing Methodologies**

**Best for:** processing workflows.

Getting Things Done, PARA, and Zettelkasten are processing frameworks that handle what you do with notes after a meeting: write them in the moment, then process them into action items and reference material in a review session. Most teams skip this step, so raw notes pile up and decisions stay buried.

## Picking a System

Your capture tool shapes what's possible downstream. Platform-specific formats constrain your options; plain files stay portable.

Char records, transcribes, and saves as markdown on your device, so you can use the files in Obsidian, Notion, VS Code, or any other tool.
