You walk out of a meeting, send a summary to the team, and feel good about it. Three weeks later someone asks "what did we decide about the timeline?" and you spend twenty minutes digging through Slack, your inbox, and two different apps before giving up and scheduling another meeting to redecide something you already decided.

Most meeting notes disappear because they're impossible to find three weeks later, even though people wrote them down at the time. This guide covers seven systems, what each does well, and how to pick one that fits how you work.

## Before You Pick a System: How Do You Search for Things?

Most teams pick tools based on hype and abandon them within weeks. Start with a simpler question: how do you search for past conversations?

Pick a system that matches how you naturally search. Do you think by date, by person, or by topic? A tool that fits your instinct lasts longer than one that requires new habits.

## Seven Systems for Organizing Meeting Notes

### **1. AI Meeting Assistants**

**Best for:** teams that want transcripts without manual filing.

The tool records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings. You get a structured summary with search.

Otter and Fireflies search across meetings, tag by project, and locate statements by date. The tradeoff: your notes live on their servers. Switching depends on export functionality. Canceling locks you out of your data.

Char saves markdown files locally. You own them.

### **2. Dedicated Note Apps (Notion, Obsidian, Evernote, OneNote, Logseq)**

**Best for:** building a linked knowledge base.

Markdown imports into Notion and Obsidian without reformatting. If you capture in Char, your notes folder opens directly in either tool.

Notion works as a queryable database. Obsidian functions as a linked web, like a personal wiki. Logseq emphasizes daily notes and task management.

### **3. A Spreadsheet or Database Index**

**Best for:** multi-project visibility.

Create a spreadsheet with one row per meeting: date, attendees, project, decisions, action items, notes link. This index lets you filter by project or person across many meetings. Scattered documents make that impossible.

### **4. CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Attio, Folk)**

**Best for:** relationship-heavy roles (sales, recruiting, account management).

A CRM stores notes on contact records. Open a contact and see the full conversation history. Most teams don't type directly into the CRM. Instead, they pipe notes in from a dedicated tool.

### **5. Wiki-Style Tools (Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki)**

**Best for:** teams that maintain documentation consistently.

Notes record what happened in a meeting. Wikis document the current state. Outdated timestamped files contradict each other. Update wiki pages instead.

Most teams abandon wikis within six months. Contradictions pile up. Adopt one only if you'll maintain it.

### **6. Email to Yourself**

**Best for:** people who rely on email search.

Notes arrive in your inbox. Gmail or Outlook search retrieves them. Your inbox is chaotic anyway, so putting notes where you already look makes sense.

### **7. GTD and Other Processing Methodologies**

**Best for:** processing workflows.

Getting Things Done, PARA, and Zettelkasten are processing frameworks. They handle what you do with notes after a meeting. Write notes in the moment. Process them into action items and reference material in a review session. Most teams skip this step. Raw notes pile up. Decisions and tasks stay buried.

## Picking a System

Your capture tool shapes everything downstream. Platform-specific formats constrain your options. Plain files stay portable.

Char records, transcribes, and saves as markdown on your device. Use the files in Obsidian, Notion, VS Code, or any other tool.
