You walk out of a meeting, send a summary to the team, and feel good about it. Three weeks later someone asks "what did we decide about the timeline?" and you spend twenty minutes digging through Slack, your inbox, and two different apps before giving up and scheduling another meeting to redecide something you already decided.

Capturing notes is easy. Finding them later is hard.

This guide covers seven systems, what each excels at, and how to pick one that fits how you work.

## Before You Pick a System: How Do You Search for Things?

People skip this question. They download whatever app had the best Product Hunt launch that week and stop using it after two months.

When you need to find something from a meeting, what comes back first -- the time it happened, the person involved, or the topic? Chronological search works if you remember when. People-based systems (CRMs, contact tools) beat folders if you organize by who. Topic-based retrieval through tags and full-text search works if you remember what was discussed.

Match your system to how you search. You'll keep using it.

## Seven Systems for Organizing Meeting Notes

### **1. AI Meeting Assistants**

**Best for:** people who value transcription and summarization over manual control.

You join a meeting, the tool records and transcribes it, and you get a structured summary with search built in. No manual filing or naming required.

Otter, Fireflies, and others do this well. Search across your entire meeting history, tag by project, find anything someone said three months ago. These tools handle both transcription and search with no manual filing needed.

Vendor lock-in is the tradeoff. Your notes are stored on their servers, and switching tools depends on export functionality. Cancel your subscription and you lose access.

Char saves notes as markdown files locally. You own the files, with no cloud dependency.

### **2. Dedicated Note Apps (Notion, Obsidian, Evernote, OneNote, Logseq)**

**Best for:** people building a personal wiki or interconnected knowledge base.

Markdown files import cleanly into Notion and Obsidian without reformatting. If you use Char for capture, your notes folder opens directly in any of these tools.

Notion functions as a queryable database (filter by project, date, attendee). Obsidian treats notes as a linked web, closer to a personal wiki. Logseq emphasizes daily notes and task tracking.

### **3. A Spreadsheet or Database Index**

**Best for:** managers tracking progress across multiple projects and teams.

Create a spreadsheet with one row per meeting (date, attendees, project, decisions, action items, notes link). The spreadsheet serves as an index for finding notes, not for storing them.

An index lets you see all meetings about a product (filtered by project) or all conversations with a client (filtered by person). Scattered individual documents make this kind of overview impossible.

### **4. CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Attio, Folk)**

**Best for:** sales, recruiting, and account management roles where relationship history matters.

A CRM stores notes on contact records. Open a contact and see the entire conversation history with that client, including what was promised and what happened next. The history stays with the person instead of scattered across old folders.

For sales, account management, recruiting, and consulting, a CRM fits well even though it's not marketed as a note tool.

CRMs are cumbersome to type in directly, so most teams connect a note-taking tool that syncs automatically.

### **5. Wiki-Style Tools (Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki)**

**Best for:** teams that maintain documentation consistently.

Notes capture what happened; wikis document current state. The gap between them matters because decisions should live on pages that get updated as conditions change, not in timestamped files that go stale.

Most teams stop maintaining wikis within six months, leaving contradictory outdated pages. Only adopt this if you commit to ongoing updates.

### **6. Email to Yourself**

**Best for:** email power-users who trust Gmail or Outlook search.

Notes arrive in your inbox; Gmail or Outlook search retrieves them when needed.

Your inbox is likely chaotic, but if search is your strength, centralizing notes where you already look has merit.

### **7. GTD and Other Processing Methodologies**

**Best for:** people who capture notes but never reference them.

Getting Things Done, PARA, and Zettelkasten are processing frameworks, not storage systems.

Separate capture from organization. Write notes quickly in the moment, then process them later into action items and reference material. Most systems fail when people skip processing entirely.

Processing matters more than the tool itself.

## Picking a System

Choose your capture tool first, because every other decision follows from it.

Platform-specific notes trap you in that ecosystem. Plain files port to any tool later.

Char records meetings, generates transcripts and summaries, and saves everything as markdown files on your device. From there, use them in Obsidian, Notion, or VS Code — whatever system you settle on, the files transfer.
