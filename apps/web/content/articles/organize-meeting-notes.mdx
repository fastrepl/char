You walk out of a meeting, send a summary to the team, and feel good about it. Three weeks later someone asks "what did we decide about the timeline?" and you spend twenty minutes digging through Slack, your inbox, and two different apps before giving up and scheduling another meeting to redecide something you already decided.

Most meeting notes disappear because finding them three weeks later proves nearly impossible, even though people wrote them down at the time. Seven systems follow, with notes on what each does well and how to choose one.

## Before You Pick a System: How Do You Search for Things?

Teams abandon note-taking tools within weeks because search breaks down. Once details fade, finding a specific note becomes the problem nobody planned for.

Pick a system that matches how you search—by date, person, or topic. Unfamiliar search methods create friction that builds until people stop using the tool.

## Seven Systems for Organizing Meeting Notes

### **1. AI Meeting Assistants**

Teams that don't want to file notes manually will get the most from these. The tool records and transcribes meetings without manual tagging. Otter and Fireflies search by project and date, but your notes live on their servers—switching tools means checking export options first. Char saves markdown locally, so you own the files.

### **2. Note Apps (Notion, Obsidian, Evernote, OneNote, Logseq)**

Markdown imports cleanly into Notion and Obsidian. Notion works as a queryable database; Obsidian creates a linked web like a personal wiki. Logseq emphasizes daily notes and task management instead. If you want a linked knowledge base, start here.

### **3. A Spreadsheet or Database Index**

One row per meeting: date, attendees, project, decisions, action items, notes link. Filter by project or person across dozens of meetings. Scattered documents can't do this. Good option when you need to track decisions across multiple projects.

### **4. CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Attio, Folk)**

A CRM displays the full conversation history when you open a contact. Most teams import notes from a separate tool because the CRM interface is awkward for typing. Sales, recruiting, and account management teams use this the most.

### **5. Wiki-Style Tools (Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki)**

Wikis work when someone owns them. Without an owner, contradictions accumulate and nobody fixes them. Most teams abandon wikis within six months. Only adopt one if your team will actually review it regularly.

### **6. Email to Yourself**

Notes land in your inbox. Gmail and Outlook search them like any other email. You don't have to remember which tool you used. People who already live in email find this surprisingly effective.

### **7. GTD and Other Processing Methodologies**

These systems add a step: write raw notes, then sort them into action items and reference material. Most teams skip the review. Raw notes pile up and decisions vanish.

## Picking a System

Your capture tool limits your options later. Platform-specific formats trap you. Plain files work everywhere.

Char saves markdown files on your device. Open them in Obsidian, Notion, VS Code, or any editor.
