You walk out of a meeting, send a summary to the team, and feel good about it. Three weeks later someone asks "what did we decide about the timeline?" and you spend twenty minutes digging through Slack, your inbox, and two different apps before giving up and scheduling another meeting to redecide something you already decided.

Most meeting notes disappear because finding them three weeks later proves nearly impossible, even though people wrote them down at the time. This guide covers seven systems, explaining what each does well and how to pick one that fits how you work.

## Before You Pick a System: How Do You Search for Things?

Teams abandon note-taking tools within weeks. The constraint that matters is search: how you find a specific note once the details have faded from memory.

Pick a system that matches how you naturally search, whether by date, by person, or by topic. Tools that fit your instinct outlast those that require new habits because the friction of an unfamiliar search method compounds over time until people stop looking altogether.

## Seven Systems for Organizing Meeting Notes

### **1. AI Meeting Assistants**

**Best for:** teams that want transcripts without manual filing.

The tool records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings, making results searchable without any manual tagging effort. Otter and Fireflies search across meetings, tag by project, and locate statements by date, though your notes live on their servers and switching or canceling depends on export functionality. Char saves markdown files locally, giving you ownership of the data.

### **2. Dedicated Note Apps (Notion, Obsidian, Evernote, OneNote, Logseq)**

**Best for:** building a linked knowledge base.

Markdown imports into Notion and Obsidian without reformatting, and captured notes from Char open directly in either tool. Notion functions as a queryable database while Obsidian creates a linked web (like a personal wiki). Logseq takes a different approach, emphasizing daily notes and task management.

### **3. A Spreadsheet or Database Index**

**Best for:** multi-project visibility.

A spreadsheet with one row per meeting (date, attendees, project, decisions, action items, notes link) lets you filter by project or person across dozens of meetings in ways that scattered documents prevent.

### **4. CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Attio, Folk)**

**Best for:** relationship-heavy roles (sales, recruiting, account management).

A CRM stores notes on contact records, displaying the full conversation history when you open a contact. Most teams pipe notes in from a dedicated tool because typing directly into the CRM interface is clunky.

### **5. Wiki-Style Tools (Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki)**

**Best for:** teams that maintain documentation consistently.

Wikis work for documenting current state, where timestamped notes become outdated and contradictory over time. Most teams abandon wikis within six months because contradictions pile up faster than anyone updates them. Adopt a wiki only if you'll commit to regular review cycles.

### **6. Email to Yourself**

**Best for:** people who rely on email search.

Notes arrive in your inbox where Gmail or Outlook search can retrieve them alongside other correspondence. This eliminates the need to remember which tool you used for a particular note, since your inbox is already where you look for past communications.

### **7. GTD and Other Processing Methodologies**

**Best for:** processing workflows.

Getting Things Done, PARA, and Zettelkasten add a processing step: write in the moment, then sort notes into action items and reference material during a review session. Most teams skip this entirely, leaving raw notes to accumulate until decisions become impossible to recover.

## Picking a System

Your capture tool limits what you can do later. Platform-specific formats lock you in while plain files stay flexible across different tools and workflows.

Char records, transcribes, and saves as markdown on your device, making the files usable in Obsidian, Notion, VS Code, or any other tool that reads plain text.
