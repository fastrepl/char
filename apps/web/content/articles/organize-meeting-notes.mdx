You walk out of a meeting, send a summary to the team, and feel good about it. Three weeks later someone asks "what did we decide about the timeline?" and you spend twenty minutes digging through Slack, your inbox, and two different apps before giving up and scheduling another meeting to redecide something you already decided.

Most meeting notes disappear because finding them three weeks later proves nearly impossible, even though people wrote them down at the time. Teams pick note systems without thinking about how they'll search for things later, and those notes end up abandoned within weeks.

## Match Your System to Search Habits

Most teams pick note tools based on features and then search using whatever method the tool provides. Match the tool to your instinct, whether you think in dates, people, or topics. I've watched teams adopt tools that work beautifully for someone else's workflow, then wonder a month later why nobody uses them.

## Tools Worth Considering

### **1. AI Meeting Assistants**

These tools record and transcribe automatically, so nobody has to take notes during the meeting. Otter and Fireflies search across projects and dates well enough for most teams, though your transcripts live on their servers and you should check export options before committing. Char saves markdown on your device, keeping files portable across editors.

### **2. Note Apps (Notion, Obsidian, Evernote, OneNote, Logseq)**

Notion stores notes as database rows you can filter, while Obsidian links documents into a web where ideas connect across meetings. Logseq adds daily notes with built-in task management that forces regular review, which some teams find more useful than the flexibility of the other two. Markdown imports cleanly into all three, so AI transcripts can feed into whichever structure fits.

### **3. A Spreadsheet or Database Index**

A spreadsheet with one row per meeting (date, attendees, project, decisions, action items, notes link) lets you filter by project or search for every meeting where a specific person was involved. Scattered documents across multiple tools lack this capability. You end up using it most when you need to track how decisions evolved across conversations, or when someone asks why the team chose a specific direction six months ago.

### **4. CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Attio, Folk)**

Opening a contact in your CRM should show the complete conversation history. Most teams write notes elsewhere and import them because CRM text editors are clunky for real-time note-taking. Sales teams, recruiters, and account managers end up here regardless, since the CRM is already central to their workflow and keeping customer conversations in one place outweighs the editing experience.

### **5. Wiki-Style Tools (Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki)**

Wikis need a designated owner. I've seen this fail repeatedly: teams set up a wiki, everyone contributes for two weeks, contradictions pile up, nobody fixes them because responsibility is unclear, and within six months people stop checking it. The wikis that survive always have someone who reviews and corrects content on a schedule.

### **6. Email to Yourself**

People who already live in their inbox tend to stick with this one. Notes land in the same place as everything else, and Gmail or Outlook search can find them by participant name, date range, or subject keywords. Multiple meetings per day make this messy though, since your inbox gets cluttered and notes lack any structure.

### **7. GTD and Other Processing Methodologies**

These systems ask you to write raw notes during meetings, then process them later into action items and reference material. Most teams skip the processing step. Raw notes accumulate, the weekly review never happens, and you end up with the same unorganized mess because most people overestimate their willingness to do regular reviews.

## File Format and Portability

Your capture tool determines what happens to your notes when you eventually switch tools. Char saves markdown locally, and those same files open in Obsidian, Notion, VS Code, or any editor without conversion. Most teams change their note-taking setup every couple of years, so format portability matters more than people realize when they first pick a system.
