You walk out of a meeting, send a summary to the team, and feel good about it. Three weeks later someone asks "what did we decide about the timeline?" and you spend twenty minutes digging through Slack, your inbox, and two different apps before giving up and scheduling another meeting to redecide something you already decided.

Capturing notes is easy. Finding them later is hard.

This guide covers seven systems, what each excels at, and how to pick one that fits how you work.

## Before You Pick a System: How Do You Search for Things?

People skip this question. They download whatever app had the best Product Hunt launch that week and stop using it after two months.

When you need to find something from a meeting, what comes back first? The time it happened, the person involved, or the topic. If you think in dates, go chronological. If you think in people, a contact-based system or CRM will serve you better than any folder structure. If you think in topics, tags and full-text search are doing the work for you already.

Pick a system that matches how you search — you'll still use it six months from now.

## Seven Systems for Organizing Meeting Notes

### **1. AI Meeting Assistants**

**Best for:** anyone who wants automatic transcription and summarization with minimal setup.

You join a meeting, the tool records and transcribes it, and you get a structured summary with search built in. No manual filing or naming required.

Otter, Fireflies, and others do this well. Search across your entire meeting history, tag by project, find anything someone said three months ago. If you want automatic transcription without fussing over organization, start here.

The tradeoff: your notes live in their platform. Switch tools and you're hoping their export works. Stop paying and your archive is at their mercy.

Char saves notes as markdown files on your device. No cloud storage by default, no vendor lock-in. The files are yours.

### **2. Dedicated Note Apps (Notion, Obsidian, Evernote, OneNote, Logseq)**

**Best for:** people building a personal wiki or interconnected knowledge base.

Markdown files import cleanly into Notion and Obsidian without reformatting. If you use Char for capture, your notes folder opens directly in any of these tools.

Notion works as a database — filter by project, attendee, or date, and build custom views for managing multiple projects. Obsidian is a web of linked pages, closer to a personal wiki. Logseq defaults to daily notes and task tracking.

### **3. A Spreadsheet or Database Index**

**Best for:** managers tracking progress across multiple projects and teams.

Create a spreadsheet with one row per meeting: date, attendees, project, decisions, action items, link to full notes. This is an index, not a notes repository.

Filter by project to see every meeting about a product launch. Filter by person to see a client's entire conversation history. This overview is difficult to get when notes are scattered across individual documents.

### **4. CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Attio, Folk)**

**Best for:** roles focused on relationship history — sales, recruiting, account management.

A CRM stores notes on contact records. Open a contact and see every conversation with that client, what was promised, and what happened next. That history stays attached to the person, not buried in a folder from eight months ago.

Sales, account management, recruiting, consulting — for these roles, a CRM is often the correct system even if nobody frames it as a note organization tool.

CRMs are clunky to type in directly. The integration that works: connect a separate note-taker to your CRM so notes sync automatically.

### **5. Wiki-Style Tools (Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki)**

**Best for:** teams that maintain documentation consistently.

A wiki differs from a notes folder. Notes record what happened in a meeting. A wiki documents what's currently true. The goal is to move decisions out of timestamped notes files and onto pages that get updated as things change.

Wikis require ongoing maintenance that most teams abandon within six months. Pages start contradicting each other and nobody knows what's current. Only choose this if your team will maintain it.

### **6. Email to Yourself**

**Best for:** email power-users with good search habits and minimal setup patience.

Notes go to your inbox. Gmail and Outlook search handles retrieval. The friction is minimal.

Your inbox is probably already a mess. But if search is your primary retrieval method, centralizing notes in a place you check constantly has some logic to it.

### **7. GTD and Other Processing Methodologies**

**Best for:** people who capture notes but never reference them.

Getting Things Done, PARA, Zettelkasten — these frameworks describe how to process notes, not where to store them.

Capture and organization are separate activities. Most systems fail because people conflate them. Capture quickly in the moment, then process later: turn raw notes into action items, reference material, and filed decisions. Unprocessed notes are clutter.

No tool saves you if you don't process afterward.

## Picking a System

Start with your capture tool. Everything else depends on that choice.

Notes locked in a specific platform limit your options to whatever that platform supports. Plain files on your device work with any tool you pick later.

Char records meetings, generates transcripts and summaries, and saves everything as markdown files on your device. From there, use them in Obsidian, Notion, or VS Code — whatever system you settle on, the files transfer.
