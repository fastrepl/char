Most teams think of GitHub as a place to store code. We treat it as the place where everything lives — code, docs, blog posts, ideas, experiments, and the entire history of how Char evolves.

This wasn't a grand strategy. It became obvious over time: if our work already happens in GitHub, why should publishing be anywhere else?

The more we used that approach, the more natural it felt. Now it's how we ship.

## You Don't Need a CMS When You Already Have Git

Most CMS platforms solve two problems:

- where your content lives
- how your team edits it

Git already solves both.

Content lives in plain files. Editing happens through commits, branches, reviews, comments, and diffs.

There are no plugins. No migrations. No schema lock-in. No surprise CMS updates that break your content model.

Just Markdown, MDX, and a repo.

You never worry about losing access to your writing because everything is portable. You can zip the folder and take it anywhere. There's a simplicity to that — something modern CMS platforms lost.

## PRs Are a Better Editorial Workflow

If you're a technical team, this part clicks immediately.

A blog post becomes a pull request. A pull request becomes a draft. Review comments become edits. A merge becomes publication.

No ceremony. No separate editorial queue. No abstracted "content status." No dashboards reinventing what Git already does.

You get:

- inline comments
- suggested changes
- clear diffs
- commit-by-commit history
- revert ability
- preview builds
- CI checks for grammar, broken links, lint rules
- permanent traceability

This is more powerful than any CMS collaboration feature because it's built on something every engineer already understands.

## Content Is Just Code, So You Get All the Benefits

Once your blog posts live in the repo, everything becomes composable.

Need a new MDX component? Ship it. Need to fix a typo? Commit it. Need to update metadata? It's frontmatter. Need to refactor how posts are structured? Write a script to do it.

You never get stuck thinking:

"How do I do this in the CMS again?"

Instead you ask:

"How do I want this to work?"

That's a better question.

## GitHub Scales With Your Team, Not Against It

Most CMS systems age poorly:

- content models become rigid
- plugins break
- WYSIWYG editors drift
- migrations become risky
- versioning becomes chaotic

GitHub is the opposite.

The larger your team grows, the more valuable its primitives become:

- branch-based workflows
- code owners for reviewing specific areas
- protected branches
- required checks
- bots for automation
- auditability

These are problems GitHub already solved at scale.

Why recreate them in a CMS?

## Images, Assets, and the Non-Code Stuff

A common argument for CMS platforms is the convenience of asset uploads.

Paste an image → instantly appears. Drag a file → gets stored in their bucket.

It's convenient.

But we don't lose that. We just do it differently.

You can:

- drag images directly into GitHub's web editor
- upload screenshots into Supabase, S3, or R2
- paste the public URL into MDX
- or commit images directly into the repo

It takes seconds.

The difference is you control the storage and the URLs forever — they're not tied to whatever CMS you used that year.

## Portability Matters More Than People Think

Every CMS feels safe until you want to leave.

Then you find:

- proprietary block formats
- hidden HTML
- vendor-specific markdown
- custom schemas
- migration scripts that only half-work

A folder of .mdx files has none of that.

If we move frameworks, hosting providers, or redesign everything from scratch, the content survives untouched.

Portability isn't a feature. It's insurance.

## GitHub Gives Us the Kind of Freedom We Care About

Writing should be simple. Shipping should be fast. Content should last.

For us, GitHub checks all three.

We don't need a CMS to feel modern. We just need something that respects how we work.

GitHub does.
