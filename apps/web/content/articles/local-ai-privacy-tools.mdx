## Intro

In the past decade, we've watched a new generation of software companies win not by collecting more data, but by collecting none. [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) built a search engine without profiling users. [Brave](https://brave.com/) gave people a browser that blocked trackers by default. [Proton](https://proton.me) delivered email and cloud storage that not even they could read.

Each of these tools succeeded by rejecting the tradeoffs that Big Tech made years ago, between usability and privacy, performance and control. They proved something: privacy isn't just a niche preference. It's a product category.

Now, AI is testing that principle again.

## Privacy, Revisited

The AI boom has delivered stunning capabilities but also renewed surveillance. A meeting you record with an AI notetaker? Sent to the cloud. A contract you upload for AI review? Logged in someone else's server. Even just asking ChatGPT a question reveals more about you than most search queries ever did.

These are not edge cases. The current generation of AI tools is fundamentally cloud-first. To use them is to surrender control over what you share, where it goes, and who might see it later.

The question becomes: where are the privacy-first tools in AI?

Just as DuckDuckGo and Brave offered new choices for search and browsing, and Proton reimagined communications, we need tools that bring the same principles into this new era.

## Why Local AI Is the Answer

When it comes to AI privacy, there's only one model that offers true assurance: local AI.

Two reasons stand out:

### 1. Physical assurance

When AI runs on your device, no data ever needs to leave it. Unlike cloud-based models that promise "we won't look," local AI guarantees "we can't look." This shifts from policy-based privacy to physics-enforced privacy.

### 2. No training risk

Even if cloud tools promise not to store data, many still reserve the right to learn from your inputs. Your private content can help train models that power other people's experiences. With local AI, there's no risk of data reuse, because there's no training loop at all. What happens on your device stays on your device.

This is a trust decision. And it's becoming the foundation of privacy in the AI age.

## A Familiar Pattern

We've seen this before.

When DuckDuckGo launched, a search engine that didn't track you felt almost paradoxical. People wanted it anyway, and the company grew steadily as users chose control over convenience.

Brave did the same for browsing. Their browser shipped with ad-blocking, fingerprinting prevention, and default tracker protection. They didn't need to explain why this mattered. People already knew.

Proton entered a crowded market of productivity apps but stood out by offering zero-access encryption and an uncompromising approach to privacy. Users weren't just buying features. They were buying values.

In each case, these companies didn't invent a new use case. They reimagined familiar ones—search, browsing, email—but refocused them around privacy.

AI is the next interface ripe for that shift.

## Where Char Comes In

At [Char](/), we're building a privacy-first AI notetaker that runs fully on-device. From transcription to summarization, every part of the experience is powered by local AI. Nothing is sent to the cloud. No audio, no text, no metadata.

We open-sourced our core app so that anyone can audit it. We support offline mode by default, and for teams that need collaboration, we offer self-hosted options that never touch external servers. You can even bring your own models.

Our users include salespeople, engineers, lawyers, doctors, and founders: people who deal with sensitive conversations every day and can't afford to compromise.

Char isn't just about note-taking. It's about building a future where AI enhances your work without owning it.

## The Privacy Stack Is Evolving

Privacy-first software is no longer just about avoiding ads. It's about creating an ecosystem of tools that work locally, transparently, and under your control.

In the past, this stack looked like:

- **Search** → DuckDuckGo
- **Browsing** → Brave
- **Communication** → Proton

Now, with the rise of AI, a new layer is forming:

- **Cognition** → Char (and others like it)

This new stack isn't defined by features. It's defined by where your data lives and who controls it. Increasingly, users are choosing tools that let them answer "me" to both.

## Final Thoughts

Cloud-first AI is colliding with a growing demand for local-first privacy. As more of our workflows get automated and augmented by AI, the need for trustworthy, transparent, and on-device solutions will grow.

Local AI is the future. Not just for performance, but for principle. Just as the early privacy pioneers reshaped the web, we're working to help reshape AI.

If you've ever used DuckDuckGo, Brave, or Proton and wished there was something similar for your meetings, we built Char for you.
