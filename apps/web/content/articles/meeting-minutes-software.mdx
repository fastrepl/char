## Detailed reviews of meeting minutes software

### 1. Char - control over your data and AI stack

![Char (foremly Char)](https://auth.hyprnote.com/storage/v1/object/public/blog/blog/char-summary.png)

**[Char](https://char.com)** is an open-source AI note-taker that stores your data locally and gives you complete control over the AI stack.

You decide if your audio, transcripts, or notes ever leave your device. You pick your preferred STT and LLM provider, which means you can go completely local if you want to.

#### How it works

Char captures system audio without joining meetings as a bot. During meetings, it transcribes conversations in real-time and combines any notes you've taken with transcripts to create a summary when the meeting ends.

#### Key Features

- **Your notes are just files** -- every meeting saved as a .md file you can open in Obsidian, Notion, VS Code, whatever you use
- **Flexible AI** lets you use the managed service or bring your own key (cloud or local). Switch anytime.
- **No meeting bots** because system audio capture works on Zoom, Teams, phone calls, in-person
- **Custom templates** structure recurring meetings automatically with community templates or your own
- **Searchable notes** let you find anything from any meeting instantly with semantic search and date filters
- **Open source** with public code. Your IT team can audit it, your security team can verify it

#### Pros

- You own your data—files stay on your device, not in a remote database
- No internet required for recording or transcription with local models
- No lock-in. Export anytime, switch AI providers anytime, or stop using it
- No bots in your meetings
- Security teams can audit the code before approving it
- Works for any conversation

#### Cons

- macOS and Linux only; Windows version coming soon 
- No video recordings 
- No built-in CRM integrations (though files export to anything)

#### Pricing

Unlimited free plan with local transcription or bring-your-own-key. Pro is $8/month for managed cloud service.

## Key features that matter in meeting minutes software

When evaluating meeting minutes software, focus on these five categories:

### 1. Transcription accuracy

Accuracy matters if you're relying on automated transcription. Look for:

- 90%+ accuracy rates for clear audio
- Speaker identification capabilities
- Support for technical terminology and industry jargon
- Custom vocabulary training for specialized terms
- Multi-language support if needed

Most AI meeting minutes software achieves 90-95% accuracy in ideal conditions, but accuracy drops significantly with background noise, accents, or multiple speakers talking simultaneously.

### 2. Privacy & security

For sensitive conversations, privacy architecture matters more than compliance certifications:

- **Local-first processing** (Char) provides maximum privacy
- **End-to-end encryption** protects data in transit
- **Compliance certifications** (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR) verify security practices
- **Data retention policies** control how long recordings are stored
- **Access controls** manage who can view sensitive meetings

If your conversations involve confidential information, prioritize tools with local processing or strong encryption over convenient cloud-based options.

### 3. Integrations

Meeting minutes software should connect with your existing workflow:

- **Calendar integration** (Google Calendar, Outlook) for automatic meeting detection
- **CRM systems** (Salesforce, HubSpot) for sales and customer data
- **Project management** (Asana, Jira, Monday.com) for task tracking
- **Communication platforms** (Slack, Teams) for sharing summaries
- **Document storage** (Google Drive, Dropbox) for archival

The best integrations are bidirectional—not just pushing data out, but pulling context in to make summaries more relevant.

### 4. Collaboration features

Teams need to work together on meeting documentation:

- **Real-time co-editing** for collaborative note-taking
- **Commenting and mentions** for feedback and questions
- **Shared agendas** built collaboratively before meetings
- **Approval workflows** for formal minutes requiring sign-off
- **Version control** to track changes and revert if needed

Remote teams particularly benefit from strong collaboration features that keep everyone aligned regardless of location.

### 5. Search & retrieval

Meeting minutes are only valuable if you can find information later:

- **Keyword search** across all transcripts and summaries
- **Semantic search** that understands context and intent
- **Filter by date, participant, or meeting type**
- **Topic-based organization** and automatic categorization
- **Quick access** to specific timestamps in recordings

The difference between a searchable meeting archive and 100 unsearchable documents is the difference between institutional knowledge and lost information.

## Our top recommendation

If you value both functionality and control, Char is worth a look. You get AI-powered features without giving up ownership of your data, and you can export everything as plain markdown with zero lock-in.

You can try the tool out for free. If it's not for you, export everything and walk away.
