## The codebase is no longer a moat

For the last two decades, the software industry believed a simple rule: if you keep your code closed, competitors cannot catch you. It was a rule built on fear and on a world where writing software required armies of engineers and thousands of hours.

That world is gone.

AI has rewritten the economics of building. A small team with strong taste now writes and ships at a pace that used to require a company of fifty. Tools like Cursor, Devin, Zed, Claude Code, GitButler, and Warp generate features in hours instead of weeks. They can refactor entire systems in a single morning. Impossible timelines become routine.

Secrecy no longer protects you the way it once did.

The real advantages now are taste, execution, and trust.

## Why open source is having a second wave

Open source dominated infrastructure for years. Linux, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, Redis, Python, Rust became the backbone of modern software. Applications never followed the same pattern. Most teams assumed real product companies needed proprietary edges, branding control, or complex business models.

But there were always exceptions. OBS Studio, Blender, VLC, Krita—people used these apps every day without thinking about whether they were open source. They used them because they worked well, respected their users, and did what they promised.

The shift is happening now. Open source is moving past infrastructure into applications—productivity tools, creative software, knowledge systems, research platforms, AI interfaces, browsers. Real tools that people depend on for real work.

## AI is accelerating open source, not replacing it

AI doesn't replace open source. It strengthens it.

AI reduces the cost of contribution and speeds up iteration. It expands what a small team can accomplish and makes community collaboration easier. It lowers the barrier to building polished interfaces and high-quality UX.

Open source no longer means slow, clunky, or "good enough for free." With AI, open source can match or exceed the pace of any closed team. Speed combined with transparency and a passionate community creates something more durable than secrecy.

## The real moat has shifted

When code becomes cheap to generate, product philosophy becomes the moat.

Can you build something that works well and respects its users? Something people trust enough to depend on?

Closed code used to signal ownership. Now it mostly signals fear.

Open source signals confidence. Users can own their tools rather than be locked inside them.

In a world shaped by opaque AI systems, transparency is valuable. In a world where data privacy matters more each year, user control is essential.

## Why we built OSS Friends

We wanted to give back to the community that shaped how we build.

OSS Friends is a directory of open source applications that inspire us. Not infrastructure or libraries or frameworks, but actual apps that people use every day. Tools that prove open source is a product philosophy, not just technical infrastructure.

You can explore the directory here: [OSS Friends](/oss-friends)

We want to highlight teams pushing software toward transparency, user ownership, and good taste. Open source applications are not niche. They are the future.

If you know an open source app that deserves attention, tell us. We want OSS Friends to grow into a place that champions the builders shaping this wave.

## The future is open, not because of ideology, but because of reality

The shift is practical, not political.

Code is no longer scarce. Taste, execution, and trust are.

Companies that understand this early will build the next decade of software. Those clinging to secrecy will find they cannot keep pace with a global open source community powered by AI.

The moat has moved.
