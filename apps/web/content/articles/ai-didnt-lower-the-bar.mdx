AI exposed how many people were coasting on execution alone.

"It works" used to be enough. Now it's the baseline. Functionality is a commodity. If all you bring is the ability to make something work, the tools can do that without you.

## Taste is what doesn't get automated

AI can generate code. It can write copy. It can design interfaces. What it can't do is tell you whether any of it is good.

Taste is knowing which template to use and when to throw it away. It's the difference between a landing page that converts and one that feels like every other landing page.

AI slop is a moral failure, not a technical one. When you publish unexamined AI output, you're asking for someone's attention and giving them something you didn't bother to read yourself. That's disrespect.

## Prompt skill is a dead end

Knowing how to write a good prompt is not a durable skill. Knowing how to iterate is.

A prompt is a one-shot attempt. Iteration is a process. You try something, see what breaks, and try again. The person who can iterate faster and notice what's wrong sooner wins. The tools are getting better every month. The interface matters less. The eye matters more.

## Experience density

Experience used to mean you'd seen a problem before and knew how to solve it. Now, a lot of those problems have known solutions that AI can look up faster than you can.

What matters is learning velocity. How fast can you pick up a new tool? How fast can you adapt when the ground shifts?

Two people can work for five years. One gets five years of learning. The other gets one year repeated five times. I call the difference experience density. It's the better predictor of who thrives in an environment where the tools change every quarter.

## Taste comes from philosophy, not credentials

Taste is about beliefs, not vibes. It's knowing what you care about and why. It's having a point of view that holds up under pressure.

At Char, we're building note-taking software. Note-taking shapes memory and cognition. That means the quality bar is non-negotiable. If the tool feels wrong, people won't use it. If it feels right, it becomes part of how they think. We can't outsource that decision to a model.

## Taste leaves artifacts

You can't fake taste over time. It shows up in what you build, what you write, and what you choose to iterate on versus what you ship and forget.

Look at someone's GitHub. Look at their writing. Look at the decisions they made when nobody was watching. That's where it lives. Resumes don't show it. Work does.

## Where this is heading

AI will keep getting better at the mechanical parts. The bar for "it works" will keep dropping. The people who were coasting on technical execution are already feeling it.

The people who have a point of view — about what good looks like, about what's worth building, about how software should feel — are the ones pulling ahead. Not because they're smarter, but because they care about something the tools can't replicate.
