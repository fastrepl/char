If you've come to rely on Gemini for day-to-day admin tasks, you're probably wondering: can it handle my meeting notes too? Yes, but the devil's in the details.

## Can Google Gemini Take Meeting Notes?

Gemini itself, the AI assistant you're familiar with, doesn't join your meetings like other [AI notetakers](/blog/best-ai-meeting-assistant-for-taking-notes). There's no "Gemini bot" that automatically hops into your Zoom calls or Teams meetings.

Instead, Google has built "Take notes with Gemini" into Google Meet. It's part of their premium Google Workspace offering, and it works differently from the regular Gemini you might use for other tasks.

When you use this feature, Gemini listens to your Google Meet conversations and creates structured notes in real-time. It shows you running summaries during the call and generates a polished document afterward with key points, decisions, and action items.

However, it only works with Google Meet.

If your team uses Zoom, Teams, or another meeting platform, you can't use the built-in solution.

## How to Use Google Gemini to Take Meeting Notes

The approach depends on whether you're sticking with Google's ecosystem or need to work with other meeting platforms.

### 1. If You're on a Google Meet Call

If your organization uses Google Workspace and you're having Google Meet calls, the process is straightforward.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCa8Zvf0XaE?si=1KZ6jyLM35RT_vpU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**During the meeting:**

- Gemini listens to the entire conversation
- Creates real-time summaries as the meeting progresses
- Shows you "Summary so far" that updates throughout the call
- Organizes everything in a structured Google Doc

**After the meeting:**

- Automatically generates a complete meeting summary
- Creates suggested next steps and action items
- Saves everything to the meeting organizer's Google Drive
- Attaches the notes doc to your Calendar event
- Emails a summary to the host and co-hosts

**Prerequisites:**

- You need Google Workspace Business Standard or higher (starting at $12/user/month)
- Your meeting must be in one of nine supported languages: English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, or Spanish
- You need enough storage space in your Google Drive
- Desktop only; no mobile support

### 2. The Manual Approach (For Everything Else)

<Image src="/api/images/blog/google-gemini-meeting-notes/gemini-1.webp" alt="Gemini"/>

For most people using Zoom, Teams, or other platforms, you'll need a more hands-on approach. Get the transcript from your meeting platform, then paste it into Gemini for summarization.

Zoom includes cloud recording with transcription on paid plans. Teams automatically transcribes when you record. Once you have that text, you can paste it into Gemini and ask for a summary.

💡 Use a prompt like this:
"Please summarize this meeting transcript. Include key decisions, action items, and next steps. Format it professionally with clear sections for main topics discussed, decisions made, and follow-up tasks assigned."

The results can be solid—Gemini excels at taking messy transcripts and turning them into clean, organized notes. But it's more work than the automated Google Meet solution, and if you prefer real-time transcription, this approach won't satisfy that need.

## What Are the Pros and Cons of Using Gemini to Take Meeting Notes?

### The Good Stuff

**It produces useful summaries.** When Gemini works, it creates surprisingly good meeting summaries. It catches key decisions, identifies action items, and organizes everything in a clean format.

**Real-time summaries help during calls.** The "Summary so far" feature during Google Meet calls is handy. You can glance over and see if you missed anything important without interrupting the flow.

**It integrates with Google's services.** Notes automatically attach to your calendar events and save to your Drive. No extra steps needed.

### The Not-So-Good Stuff

**Subscription costs are expensive.** At $12-18 per user per month for Workspace plans that include this feature, larger teams face significant costs. A 20-person company pays $2,880-4,320 annually just to take meeting notes in Google Meet.

**Privacy concerns exist.** Every word spoken gets uploaded to Google's servers. That may be fine for internal team meetings, but client consultations, legal discussions, or healthcare conversations raise compliance questions for many organizations.

**Manual workflows are tedious.** For non-Google Meet platforms, you're handling the work yourself: downloading transcripts, copying text, crafting prompts, and organizing results. It defeats the purpose of automation.

### So Should You Use It?

After testing Google Gemini meeting notes extensively, it works well if you meet these three criteria:

- Your entire organization uses Google Meet exclusively
- You're comfortable with Google processing sensitive conversations
- You're already paying for expensive Workspace subscriptions

If any of those don't apply—and for most teams at least one doesn't—you'll find yourself constantly working around limitations rather than benefiting from the automation.

## What Is the Best Alternative to Gemini for Note-taking?

The list of alternatives is extensive. Any decent AI meeting assistant can outperform Gemini. We have comprehensive articles on AI note-takers for [Google Meet](/blog/best-ai-notetakers-google-meet), [Zoom](/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom), and [Microsoft Teams](/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-microsoft-teams).

If I had to choose one platform that works universally, is free, and keeps your data local, I'd recommend Char.

Quick disclaimer: I'm the co-founder of Char. Despite that, my recommendation isn't driven by personal bias.

Here's what it delivers:

- **Local-first privacy.** Char is a [local AI notepad](/product/local-ai) that uses on-device AI models to transcribe and summarize meetings without sending data to the cloud.
- **Universal platform support.** Works with any meeting software and in-person conversations without bots or restrictions.
- **Real-time intelligence.** Live transcription and summaries while meetings happen, not just afterward.
- **Flexible deployment.** Run locally on your Mac or deploy on-premises for enterprise teams.
- **Fast implementation.** Core features free forever. Pro upgrade ($8/month) only when you need advanced functionality.
- **Reduces compliance risks.** Local processing cuts down audit trails and third-party data exposure concerns.

Char's note-taking and summarizing features include:

- **Familiar interface.** Works like Apple Notes with powerful AI running locally in the background.
- **Custom templates.** Formats tailored for therapy sessions, legal meetings, job interviews, or casual conversations.
- **Search your meeting history naturally.** Ask "What did Sarah say about the budget?" instead of scrolling through months of notes.
- **AI chat for instant answers.** Get immediate clarification about action items, deadlines, or who said what during meetings.
- **Control AI's changes to your notes.** Choose minimal improvements to your original thoughts or complete AI restructuring.
- **Verify AI-generated points.** Hover over summaries to see the exact transcript quote behind each point.

The difference is significant. Instead of hoping Google's limited solution works with your workflow, you get a tool that adapts to how your team actually meets.
