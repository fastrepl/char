Zoom users report spending hours editing 45-60 minute transcripts due to poor accuracy and formatting issues. Char's advanced AI models provide superior transcription quality with minimal manual cleanup required.

#### 2. Privacy and Control

Zoom processes your conversations in the cloud, raising compliance concerns for sensitive industries. Char keeps everything on your device—your data never leaves your computer.

#### 3. Intelligence vs. Basic Text

Zoom gives you raw transcript files that require manual organization. Char delivers structured notes with automatic extraction of key points, decisions, and action items.

#### 4. Long-term Value

Zoom transcripts sit in isolation, making them difficult to search across meetings or connect insights over time. Char builds a searchable knowledge base where you can find patterns, track decisions, and understand the evolution of projects.

#### 5. Interactive Intelligence

Zoom gives you static transcript files. Char lets you have conversations with your meeting notes through AI chat—ask "What are my action items?" or "What exactly did Sarah say about the budget?" and get instant answers without scrolling through pages of text.

#### 6. Flexibility

Zoom locks you into their ecosystem and processing limitations. Char works with any meeting platform, offers custom templates, and gives you complete deployment flexibility, from local-only processing to on-premises deployment to private cloud options.

Char offers its core features, including unlimited AI summaries and transcription free forever. Give it a try.
