tl;dv markets itself as "free forever." It is, technically. You can record unlimited meetings and get transcripts without paying. But the AI summaries that make those transcripts useful? You get 10. Total. Not monthly. After that, you're reading raw transcripts or paying $29/month.

That pricing gap between free and paid is one of the steepest in the market. Most competitors charge $12-19 for comparable features. Some are actually free.

I've been testing meeting tools for months and wrote a [full tl;dv review](/blog/tldv-review) if you want the deep dive. This article is for people who already know they want something else and need to decide what.

## What pushes people away from tl;dv

I've analyzed hundreds of G2 and Reddit reviews. These come up repeatedly:

**The free plan runs out fast.** 10 lifetime AI summaries sounds like a trial, not a free tier. Most people burn through them in their first two weeks, then face raw transcripts or a $29/month bill.

**$29/month is a lot.** Fireflies is $18. MeetGeek is $19. Otter is $16.99. Char's managed cloud is $8, and it's free with your own API keys. tl;dv's Pro plan doesn't include anything that justifies the premium.

**The bot.** tl;dv joins meetings as a visible participant. In client calls and investor meetings, "tl;dv Notetaker" in the participant list creates questions you'd rather not answer.

**No offline, no in-person.** Cloud-only, and limited to Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams. Drop your WiFi mid-meeting and you lose everything. Need to record a phone call or in-person conversation? Can't.

**Accuracy with accents.** Users in our review noted that transcription quality drops with non-native English speakers and technical jargon. No custom vocabulary option, so specialized teams edit transcripts after every call.

## 7 Best tl;dv Alternatives: Detailed Reviews

### 1. Char

[Char](/) is an open-source AI notepad for meetings that stores everything as plain markdown files on your device. No proprietary database, no cloud dependency. You pick the AI provider: managed cloud, your own API keys (OpenAI, Deepgram, Anthropic, whatever), or local models through Ollama. It looks like Apple Notes with AI superpowers, capturing audio from any meeting platform without joining as a bot.

#### How it compares to tl;dv

tl;dv sends your audio to their servers, then to Anthropic for processing. You get video clips and sales coaching in return. Char skips the video entirely and gives you text-based meeting intelligence with complete data ownership. tl;dv Pro is $29/month. Char is free for local transcription and BYOK, or $8/month for managed cloud. If you left tl;dv over pricing or privacy, the gap here is wide.

#### Top Features

- Plain markdown files stored locally—works with any tool (Obsidian, Notion, VS Code)
- Your choice of AI stack: managed cloud, bring your own keys, or run local models
- Open source with full transparency into the codebase
- Customizable templates for different meeting types (therapy, legal, interviews)
- AI Chat with source quotes from the exact transcript line
- Calendar integration with notification system
- Conversational search across all meeting history
- Works offline and with in-person meetings

#### Pros

- Zero vendor lock-in—switch AI providers anytime, export your files anywhere
- No meeting bots to disrupt conversations
- Free forever for local transcription, BYOK, and all core features
- Works with any meeting platform or in-person discussions

#### Cons

- Currently macOS only (Windows coming soon)
- No video recording by design for maximum privacy
- Mic level speaker identification
- No direct CRM sync

#### Pricing

Free forever for local transcription, BYOK, and all core features. Managed cloud is $8/month. Enterprise plans include on-premises deployment, SSO integration, and consent management.

### 2. Fathom

[Fathom](https://fathom.video/) has the free plan tl;dv pretends to have. Unlimited recording, unlimited transcription, and AI summaries that reset monthly instead of running out forever. You get 5 AI summaries per month on the free tier, which is enough for most people who aren't in meetings all day.

#### How it compares to tl;dv

Both tools use bots and generate post-meeting summaries. Fathom's analytics are shallower than tl;dv's multi-meeting intelligence. But if you left tl;dv over pricing or the misleading free plan, Fathom is the most direct replacement. Processing is faster too—summaries appear almost immediately after the call ends, where tl;dv sometimes takes a minute.

#### Top Features

- Unlimited free recording and transcription with no lifetime limits
- "Ask Fathom" AI assistant for querying past meetings
- CRM sync with Salesforce and HubSpot
- Video highlights for sharing moments from calls
- Instant post-meeting processing

#### Pros

- Free plan that resets monthly instead of running out
- CRM integrations work smoothly and save manual data entry
- Handles multiple speakers and accents reasonably well
- Fast setup with calendar integration

#### Cons

- Bot joins meetings visibly, same as tl;dv
- Team features require paid plans
- Works best on Zoom; other platforms feel secondary
- Trains AI on your meetings unless you opt out manually
- No offline capability

#### Pricing

Free unlimited recording. Premium at $19/month for team features and unlimited AI summaries.

### 3. Grain

If you're leaving tl;dv but actually used the video clip features, [Grain](https://grain.com/) does that part better and cheaper. It's built around the same idea—record meetings, create shareable video highlights—but starts at $15/month instead of $29.

#### How it compares to tl;dv

Grain's clip creation and highlight reels are more polished than tl;dv's. The interface for browsing and sharing moments is cleaner. What you lose is tl;dv's multi-meeting analytics and sales coaching. If you used those, Grain isn't the right move. If you mostly made clips and shared them with your team, it is.

#### Top Features

- Video highlight reels from meeting moments
- Shareable clips with one click
- CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Team library for organizing recordings
- Smart chapters for navigation
- 25 language transcription

#### Pros

- Best-in-class video clip creation and sharing
- Clean interface for browsing meeting moments
- Good CRM integrations for sales teams
- Affordable compared to tl;dv for similar video features

#### Cons

- Bot records meetings, same visibility issue
- Only 5 free recordings (more limited than tl;dv's free tier)
- Video-centric design is overkill if you just want text notes
- No offline or local processing

#### Pricing

Free with 5 recordings. Starter at $15/month. Business at $29/month.

### 4. Fireflies

[Fireflies.ai](https://fireflies.ai/) is a conversation intelligence platform that matches most of what tl;dv does at $18/month instead of $29. Speaker analytics, sentiment analysis, topic tracking, keyword monitoring across calls.

#### How it compares to tl;dv

The conversation intelligence that tl;dv locks behind Pro and Business tiers, Fireflies includes at a lower price point. Where Fireflies falls short: no video clip creation, and the sales coaching playbooks aren't as developed. Where it wins: 69 languages (tl;dv has 30), unlimited free transcription, and a larger integration ecosystem.

#### Top Features

- AskFred AI assistant for querying across meetings
- Speaker analytics, sentiment analysis, topic tracking
- 69 languages with auto-detection
- Unlimited free transcription (tl;dv caps AI summaries at 10)
- Collections for grouping related meetings

#### Pros

- Broader language support than almost any competitor
- Strong conversation analytics at a lower price
- AskFred works well for searching across months of calls
- Large integration ecosystem

#### Cons

- Bot records meetings visibly
- Some users report confusing billing and trial cancellation
- Accuracy drops outside English despite claiming 69 languages
- AI credits add hidden cost on top of subscription

#### Pricing

Free unlimited transcription with limited storage. Pro at $18/month. Business at $29/month.

### 5. Tactiq

[Tactiq](https://tactiq.io/) runs as a Chrome extension. No bot joins your call. No one in the meeting knows you're transcribing unless you tell them. If the bot was your main problem with tl;dv, this solves it directly.

#### How it compares to tl;dv

Unlike tl;dv's bot-based approach, Tactiq works invisibly in your browser and shows the transcript live during the meeting. tl;dv doesn't offer that real-time view. The trade-off: Chrome only, no video recording, and limited to three meeting platforms. At $12/month it's less than half tl;dv's price.

#### Top Features

- Live transcription visible during calls
- 60 languages with auto-detection
- Custom AI workflows and reusable prompts
- Integrations with Slack, HubSpot, Jira, Linear
- No audio storage (privacy-friendly)

#### Pros

- No meeting bot disruption
- See transcripts while the meeting is happening
- Fast setup—works immediately after installing the extension
- Custom prompts for specific meeting outputs

#### Cons

- Chrome only. No Firefox, Safari, Arc, or desktop app.
- Limited to Google Meet, Zoom, and Teams
- No video recording or clips
- Accuracy issues with accents
- Can't record in-person meetings

#### Pricing

Free with 10 meetings/month and 5 AI credits. Pro at $12/month.

### 6. MeetGeek

[MeetGeek](https://meetgeek.ai/) auto-detects whether you're in a sales call, team standup, or client review, then applies the right template and workflow. tl;dv has custom templates but you configure them manually. MeetGeek does it for you, which saves time when you're moving between 8 different meeting types per week.

#### How it compares to tl;dv

MeetGeek intelligently categorizes meetings and provides specialized insights for different contexts. tl;dv treats all meetings similarly unless you manually configure templates. The pricing makes more sense too—Pro is $19/month for features that overlap heavily with tl;dv's $29/month plan. MeetGeek also offers HIPAA compliance, which tl;dv doesn't.

#### Top Features

- Automatic meeting type detection with context-aware summaries
- Conversation analytics and engagement metrics
- Workflow automation to Slack, Notion, CRM
- 50 languages
- HIPAA compliance available
- Meeting KPI tracking

#### Pros

- Automatic categorization saves setup time
- HIPAA compliance for healthcare and legal teams
- Good multilingual support for international teams
- Strong analytics and coaching insights

#### Cons

- Bot records meetings visibly
- Free plan is only 3 hours/month (about 3-4 meetings)
- Auto-categorization isn't always right
- No offline or local processing

#### Pricing

Free with 3 hours/month. Pro at $19/month. Business at $29/month.

### 7. Supernormal

[Supernormal](https://www.supernormal.com/) costs $10/month. That's a third of tl;dv's Pro plan. If you're paying $29/month and mostly just reading the AI summaries and action items, you're overpaying.

#### How it compares to tl;dv

Supernormal handles the basics: transcription, summaries, action items, integrations with Slack and Notion. It has a pre-meeting prep feature that pulls context from past meetings before you join a new one, which nobody else does. What you lose: video recording, multi-meeting analytics, sales coaching. What you keep: the part most people actually use every day.

#### Top Features

- Meeting notes with summaries and action items
- Pre-meeting prep from past meeting context
- Video recording with key moment detection
- Slack, Notion, and CRM integrations
- Chrome extension for lightweight capture

#### Pros

- Cheapest paid option on this list
- Pre-meeting context is a unique time-saver
- Covers daily meeting needs without extra complexity
- Clean, simple interface

#### Cons

- Limited language support
- Bot joins meetings by default
- No multi-meeting analytics or coaching features
- Transcript accuracy varies
- Smaller ecosystem than established competitors

#### Pricing

Free plan available. Pro at $10/month.

## Picking the right one

This depends on why you're leaving tl;dv.

**Leaving over the free plan?** Fathom has unlimited free recording with monthly-resetting AI summaries.

**Leaving over the bot?** Char records system audio directly. Tactiq works through Chrome. Neither joins your call as a participant.

**Leaving over the price?** Fireflies ($18/mo) and MeetGeek ($19/mo) offer comparable conversation intelligence. Supernormal ($10/mo) covers the basics. Char is free with BYOK.

**Leaving for privacy reasons?** Char processes everything on your device. Open source, auditable, works offline. Nothing else on this list comes close on data control.

**Leaving because you need in-person recording?** Char captures system audio and microphone input. Works for in-person conversations, phone calls, and any meeting platform.
