## Is Char free?

Char offers a free tier with core features. Pro features like unlimited recording time, advanced templates, and priority support are available through our paid plans.

## Can I try Pro features before subscribing?

Yes! New users get a 14-day free trial of Char Pro to try all features before committing to a subscription. Your trial ends automatically — you won't be charged unless you explicitly subscribe.

## How do I cancel my subscription?

Open Char and go to **Settings** > **Account** > **Manage Subscription**. This opens the Stripe billing portal where you can cancel, update payment info, or switch plans. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period — you keep Pro access until then. You can also reach the billing portal through the in-app support chat.

## Can I get a refund?

If you were charged unexpectedly or are unhappy with your subscription, reach out via the in-app support chat or email us. We handle refund requests on a case-by-case basis through Stripe.
