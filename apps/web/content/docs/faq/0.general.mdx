## What is Char?

Char is a desktop notetaking application that captures both your microphone and system audio. It uses local AI to transcribe conversations, generate summaries, and help you organize your notes - all while keeping your data private on your device.

## Why do I need to create an account?

Char is a local-first app — all your notes, transcripts, and recordings are stored as plain files on your device. Creating an account is optional but unlocks cloud-powered features like cloud transcription, cloud AI summaries, and a free Pro trial. Your local data is never affected by your account status. Learn more in [Why Local-First?](/docs/about/why-local-first) and [Privacy](/docs/faq/privacy).

## How is Char different from other meeting recorders?

Unlike bot-based recorders that join your meetings, Char runs locally on your computer and captures audio directly from your system. This means it works with any application, doesn't require meeting permissions, and keeps all your data private.
