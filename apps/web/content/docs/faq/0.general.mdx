## What is Char?

Char is a desktop notetaking application that captures both your microphone and system audio. It uses local AI to transcribe conversations, generate summaries, and help you organize your notes - all while keeping your data private on your device.

## What platforms does Char support?

Char is currently available for **macOS** only (Apple Silicon and Intel). Windows, Linux, and mobile are not yet available — they are on our roadmap but we don't have a timeline to share. Follow our [GitHub](https://github.com/charapp/char) or [changelog](/changelog) for updates.

## How is Char different from other meeting recorders?

Unlike bot-based recorders that join your meetings, Char runs locally on your computer and captures audio directly from your system. This means it works with any application, doesn't require meeting permissions, and keeps all your data private. Learn more in [What is Char?](/docs/about/what-is-hyprnote) and [Why Local-First?](/docs/about/why-local-first).
